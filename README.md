# enable-javascript
How can you explain to your users how to enable JavaScript in their browser? You can put a link to this webpage that will explain that to your users.

## Guides
- Google Chrome
- Mozilla Fireox
- Opera Browser
- Safari
- Brave
- Microsoft Edge

## Use

Copy this URL : `https://welpike.github.io/enable-javascript/` and put it on your website.

The site will show to the user if JS is activated on them browser and display a guide for enable JS for each browser.

## Back feature

You can update URL for some of your needs.

- `https://welpike.github.io/enable-javascript/?back=closetab` -> if you put a link that opens a new tab, when user will clicks on the back icon, the tab will be closed.
- `https://welpike.github.io/enable-javascript/?back=historyback` (default) -> if you put a simple link, when user clicks on the back icon, they will be redirected to the page before in history (`history.back()`).

## Coming soon...

- customization of the theme of the webpage (`?theme={theme}`).
- translations.
- new browsers on the list.
- if you have any other ideas...
